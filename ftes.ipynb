In a nutshell, when you graduate, go to this link: https://cal.berkeley.edu/ Then there is a forwarding thing on the bottom\n",
        "+ Well so far, it does seem to be working for me and I graduated in '10, so I thought the video was pretty useful (obviously)!\n",
        "+ Gerald, in your case you're lucky, because they did the conversion thing AFTER you graduated. Some new policies might not apply to you. That's like some grandfathered benefits. But for students who have not graduated yet, it won't work because the new system will make sure to delete the accounts belong to anyone who is no longer registered for nine months, and the authentication will then fail. But that video is beneficial to the ones who want to use bMail more easily and to save all conversations permanently.\n",
        "+ Jordan, your bMail account will be deleted nine months after you're no longer affiliated with Cal. But if you graduate, during that grace period, you have the option to keep your @berkeley.edu address forever by converting it to a forwarding address, but then you might not be able to send it from berkeley.edu domain, and that's how Abdull's video can help you.\n",
        "+ Randy Wei Thanks for your input\n",
        "+ Yeah, mine's the same. All it is is a forwarding address.\n",
        "+ hmm, I graduated in '12 but then did research so my email address turned into a bMail account. I got an email a few days ago saying it would expire in a few months. I did set up a @cal.berkeley.edu forwarding address but is there any way I can get my original @Berkeley.edu address as a forwarding address too?\n",
        "+ I logged into https://calmail.berkeley.edu/ and just clicked on \"Manage Your Account\". It then said: \"You do not currently own a CalMail account, nor are you eligible to create an account.\" (because I'd \"upgraded\" mine to be a permanent forward), but could click on \"Manage Your Redirects\" and adjust my original @berkeley address where I needed.\n",
